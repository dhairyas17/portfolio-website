title: Choosing the Right Database for Your Product
excerpt: From relational to NoSQL, choosing the right database depends on your product's data model, query needs, consistency guarantees, and future scale. Here's my practical mental model for making that choice.

## Why Database Choice Isn’t Just a Tech Decision

As a Technical Product Manager, I’ve learned that choosing a database isn't just about tech specs — it’s a **product strategy decision**.

The wrong choice:
- Slows dev velocity
- Breaks under scale
- Leads to expensive migrations

The right one:
- Aligns with your data model
- Matches your consistency vs. availability trade-offs
- Scales with your product roadmap

This post is my framework for choosing databases that serve both the **technical** and **product** goals of a system.

## 1. Understand the Data Shape and Access Patterns

Before looking at databases, get brutally clear on:
- What does the data look like? (Tabular, hierarchical, document, time-series)
- How is it accessed? (Joins? Aggregations? Search-heavy? Writes vs. reads?)

📌 **Examples:**
- Tabular + transactional? → Likely a relational DB.
- Flexible schema, nested docs? → Think NoSQL (MongoDB, Couchbase).
- Time-series metrics? → InfluxDB, TimescaleDB.

---

## 2. Transactional Integrity vs. Availability

### Do you need **ACID** or **eventual consistency**?

**Relational DBs (PostgreSQL, MySQL)** shine when:
- You need **strong consistency**
- Schema validation matters
- You perform lots of **multi-row or multi-table transactions**

**NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB)** work best when:
- You prioritize **scalability and availability**
- You can tolerate **eventual consistency**
- You’re dealing with **high write throughput**

---

## 3. Read/Write Load and Scaling Needs

Understand how your load behaves:
- **Write-heavy workloads** → DynamoDB, Cassandra, Kafka + storage
- **Read-heavy, global traffic** → CDN-backed caches, read replicas, or globally distributed DBs like CockroachDB

📌 Don’t just think about “today” — **design for your next 10x**.

---

## 4. Operational Complexity: Who Will Manage This?

Will your team operate the DB, or will you go **managed**?

- Self-hosted PostgreSQL is powerful, but needs ops maturity
- DynamoDB or Firebase scale easily — but lock you into cloud platforms
- MongoDB Atlas, PlanetScale, Supabase = excellent managed trade-offs

🎯 Ask: *Do we want control, or do we want to ship faster?*

---

## 5. Analytics vs. Transactions: Split Your Workloads

You may need **OLTP** for product logic and **OLAP** for reporting.

> Don’t force analytics onto your transactional DB.

🛠 Consider:
- OLTP: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- OLAP: BigQuery, Snowflake, ClickHouse
- ETL: dbt, Airbyte, Apache NiFi

---

## 6. Some Personal Rules of Thumb

✅ Default to **PostgreSQL** unless you have a reason not to. It’s mature, powerful, and has extensions for almost everything.

✅ Avoid **premature sharding** — scale vertically or via replicas first.

✅ For early-stage products, use managed DBs like:
- Supabase (Postgres + auth + real-time)
- MongoDB Atlas
- Firebase (if front-end dev speed matters more than schema safety)

---

## 7. Final Cheat Sheet

| Use Case | Recommended DB |
|----------|----------------|
| Product + transactional logic | PostgreSQL, MySQL |
| Unstructured, flexible schema | MongoDB, Couchbase |
| Real-time analytics | ClickHouse, Rockset |
| Time-series data | TimescaleDB, InfluxDB |
| Global scale with low ops | DynamoDB, PlanetScale |
| Mobile apps / quick MVPs | Firebase, Supabase |

---

## Final Thoughts

Choosing a database isn’t a one-time decision — it evolves with the product. What works at MVP stage may break at scale. And what scales beautifully might slow down developer velocity.

My advice: **Choose for today, design for tomorrow.**
