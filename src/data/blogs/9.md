_"Shipping software at the edge means building reliability twice: once in the cloud, once in deployment."_

Scaling to more than 1,200 edge devices taught me that success is not just about deploying models. It is about building product-grade infrastructure that behaves like a SaaS backend, even when users are offline, remote, or on unreliable 4G connections. 

This is how we operationalized observability and OTA updates for a global fleet of NVIDIA Jetsons, with the mindset of a TPM treating infrastructure as product.

### Problem Statement

Once deployments passed 100 units, we started hitting recurring pain points:

- Manual updates: Engineers SSHing into devices to fix bugs created a bottleneck  
- Poor visibility: No insight into device status, logs, or model health  
- Inconsistent versions: Firmware, model, and supporting code drifted across devices  

It became clear we needed a reliable OTA pipeline and fleet-wide observability ,  quickly.

### What Made It Work

#### Think Like a SaaS Product

We applied cloud engineering patterns to the edge:

- Version control everything, including firmware, config, and models  
- Use canary releases for OTA rollouts, orchestrated by Airflow DAGs  
- Implement retries and rollbacks so every failure is recoverable  

#### Build Edge-first UX for Engineers

Our end users were internal teams ,  ops, CV, and ML engineers managing the fleet:

- CLI tools and Grafana dashboards for quick insights  
- Push alerts directly to Slack channels  
- Visual diff of model versions and metrics before and after deployment  

#### Apply Cross-functional Product Thinking

This was not just infrastructure; it was a product:

- PMs drove faster bug fix deployments for customers  
- Ops teams flagged field issues like network drops or full storage  
- ML engineers needed better traceability for model failures in production  

We ran weekly “EdgeOps Standups” where the fleet was treated as a user persona.

### Lessons to Carry Forward

- Build OTA and observability together ,  visibility is what makes safe updates possible  
- Treat every device like a cloud instance ,  versioned, monitored, and documented  
- Start staged rollouts early ,  even with small fleets, they prevent large-scale failure  
- Design for disconnection ,  unstable networks are the norm, not the exception  

### What’s Next

We are exploring:

- Federated OTA triggers that update models only when local data shifts  
- Real-time model benchmarking through the observability stack  
- Auto-healing workflows that trigger directly from monitoring events  

Scaling edge infrastructure is not just about more devices. It is about making the fleet behave like a single, resilient product.
