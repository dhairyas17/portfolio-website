As a Technical Product Manager working across AI, MLOps, and Edge deployments, my days live at the intersection of product, engineering, and execution. I don’t just sit in meetings — I prototype, spec, visualize, and track. Here are the ten tools that have become mission-critical to how I operate.

---

## 1. **Productboard** – For Clarity in the Chaos

Centralizing customer feedback, roadmap priorities, and feature requests across AI & infra workstreams is messy — Productboard makes it manageable. I use it to tie initiatives directly to OKRs and make stakeholder tradeoffs visible.

---

## 2. **Notion** – My Second Brain

From tracking model experiments to writing PRDs, Notion powers my async collaboration. I've set up AI agent design templates, firmware rollout checklists, and MLOps learning docs all within a single workspace.

---

## 3. **Lucidchart / Excalidraw** – Communicate Systems, Fast

A diagram is worth a thousand Slack threads. I use Lucidchart for stakeholder-ready diagrams and Excalidraw when I want to whiteboard architecture in real time — especially useful when syncing edge-cloud systems.

---

## 4. **Slack + Huddles** – For Fast, Unfiltered Engineering Syncs

Speed > Polish. A quick huddle with annotators or ML engineers saves days of back-and-forth. I pin all infra updates and OTA statuses in Slack channels to keep ops teams unblocked.

---

## 5. **MLflow + Airflow** – My MLOps Control Center

I might not write the training pipelines, but I must understand, debug, and prioritize them. MLflow helps track versions and experiments. Airflow ensures reproducibility. Together, they’re non-negotiable for AI product reliability.

---

## 6. **Linear** – Issue Tracking That Doesn’t Suck

JIRA feels like a legacy tax. Linear brings speed and clarity. I run dev sprints, firmware update rollouts, and bug triage using custom workflows, all integrated with Slack and GitHub.

---

## 7. **Figma** – Aligning UX with Technical Constraints

Working with UX on AI-heavy apps? Figma lets me ensure that frontend design maps cleanly to what’s technically feasible — especially when real-time inference latency shapes UI.

---

## 8. **Grafana + Prometheus** – Observability for Edge & Cloud

You can't ship edge products blind. I rely on these tools for real-time telemetry from 1,200+ Jetson devices. Alerts for CPU/GPU/memory spikes have saved us from outages more than once.

---

## 9. **ChatGPT + GitHub Copilot** – Force Multiplier, Daily

From explaining new TensorRT optimizations to writing shell scripts for OTA updates, these tools compress my learning curve and increase velocity. As a TPM, they help me operate closer to engineering without blocking.

---

## 10. **Miro** – Driving Alignment Across Timezones

From stakeholder maps to MLOps pipeline planning, Miro helps facilitate collaboration across distributed teams. It’s where we build shared understanding — especially when technical + business need to converge.

---

## Bonus: Bash + VSCode

Because sometimes, I just need to SSH into a Jetson, check logs, or tweak deployment scripts. Staying hands-on builds credibility, unblocks teams, and helps me see around corners.

---

### Why This Matters

Being a TPM in AI and Cloud isn't about running status meetings — it's about driving clarity, velocity, and outcomes in complex systems. These tools make that possible.
