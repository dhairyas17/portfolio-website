When I first stepped into the world of AI product development, I was surrounded by ML researchers, data scientists, annotators, and DevOps engineers—each expert in their own domain. I wasn’t the smartest engineer in the room, nor did I need to be. My job as a TPM was to create clarity, alignment, and momentum.

## The Core Challenge

Unlike traditional software teams, AI product teams deal with uncertainty at many levels: unclear data quality, unpredictable model performance, and research-driven timelines. Success doesn't come from shipping code fast, but from building the right feedback loops and managing iteration.

My key realization: **You don’t need to write models to lead model teams—you need to ship impact, not math.**

## 1. Orchestrating Multi-Disciplinary Teams

A typical week had me interfacing with:

- **Researchers**, asking: “What’s blocking experimentation?”
- **MLOps Engineers**, aligning on: “Is our training infra scalable and reproducible?”
- **Annotators**, ensuring: “Are we getting the right edge cases labeled?”
- **PMs**, syncing on: “Are we investing effort in the highest-leverage use cases?”

I acted as the glue. Not by solving all problems directly, but by setting context, asking the right questions, and moving information across silos.

## 2. Shipping through Process, not Power

In AI teams, ambiguity is the norm. What helped me:

- **Weekly ML syncs**: We used Monday reviews to align research progress with deployment targets.
- **Annotation pipelines**: I worked with Ops to automate edge case discovery using failure triggers.
- **MLOps visibility**: We shipped dashboards that showed model drift and confidence metrics.

Instead of micromanaging, I facilitated rhythm and predictability.

## 3. Balancing Product Roadmap and Research Reality

One example stands out.

> Our PM was pushing for a new predictive feature for our edge product. Meanwhile, researchers were exploring whether the underlying model architecture could even support such forecasting.

Rather than waiting for certainty, we framed milestones like:

- “By Sprint 2: show signal in noisy data”
- “By Sprint 4: deploy in silent mode for metrics”

This staged delivery helped both sides stay in sync while reducing risk.

## 4. The Soft Side: Respect and Translation

You don’t earn trust from AI teams by pretending to know it all. You earn it by:

- Asking intelligent questions
- Summarizing problems clearly to execs
- Taking blockers off their plate

Often, I translated a researcher’s abstract concern into a tactical decision for the PM or Ops team.

## 🗣️ Stakeholder Narrative

There was a moment when our annotation team flagged a bottleneck—data labeling was lagging by 2 weeks due to unclear edge case definitions.

Instead of escalating, I brought together the ML lead, annotator lead, and PM into a single 30-minute working session. We redefined “critical” edge cases and automated the pipeline to surface them using confidence thresholds. That 2-week lag turned into a 3-day SLA within a sprint.

## 🔍 Reflection: What I’d Do Better Next Time

- Bring annotators into design reviews earlier—label schema clarity is half the battle.
- Set clearer thresholds for “good enough” in research timelines to prevent scope creep.
- Invest more in automated retraining pipelines early—even if the models aren't perfect.

Leading AI teams as a TPM is not about being the smartest, but about being the clearest. When you remove friction, ideas flow, and models ship.
