Transitioning from an engineer to a Technical Product Manager (TPM) wasn’t a promotion — it was a transformation. I went from shipping CV models to shipping outcomes. From writing code to writing context. From owning features to owning alignment.

This post captures the core lessons I learned on that journey — particularly around influencing without authority.

## 👨‍💻 The Engineer’s Comfort Zone

As a CV Engineer, life was scoped and concrete:  
- Jira tickets had clear definitions  
- Performance metrics were binary: accuracy up or down  
- Communication happened mostly in Git commits, pull requests, and model cards  

I could measure my value in models trained, bugs fixed, and FPS achieved on Jetson.

But then I became the bridge — between engineering, product, ops, and leadership. That’s where the real stretch began.

## 🚧 The First Roadblock: “You’re Not My Manager”

As a new TPM, I remember asking an MLOps engineer if they could reprioritize a feature for deployment observability. Their reply?

> _"We already have our sprint locked. Can’t pick that now."_  

Fair. But the outcome was still on me. That’s when I realized:

> **As a TPM, you own problems — not people.**

So I had to learn to influence without control. Here’s how I started.

---

## 🎯 Lesson 1: Align Around Outcomes, Not Output

Instead of asking, _“Can you build X?”_, I learned to say:

> _“Our OTA failure rate spiked 22% last month. If we can monitor device state during update rollout, we can avoid 80% of failures.”_

Suddenly, I wasn’t asking for a feature. I was asking for impact.

Engineers don’t push back on meaningful problems. They push back on vague asks.

## 🤝 Lesson 2: Build Trust Before You Need It

Every reliable collaboration I had as a TPM started with **informal alignment** — Slack chats, async Looms, lunch table convos.

I’d DM researchers things like:

> _“Hey — saw you merged that data ingestion pipeline refactor. I think this could help us with live tagging soon. Want to jam?”_

These 1:1s built relational equity — so when roadmap disagreements came, we weren’t strangers on opposite sides.

## ⚖️ Lesson 3: Speak *Their* Language

When I was a CV engineer, I rolled my eyes at Gantt charts. As a TPM, I learned to translate:

- For **engineers**: latency budgets, tech debt ratios, performance bottlenecks
- For **designers**: use-case personas, edge-device UX constraints
- For **ops**: rollout risk, monitoring gaps, log traceability
- For **execs**: value delivered, timelines de-risked, customer impact

Influence is fluency. Every stakeholder speaks a different dialect.

## 🧩 Lesson 4: Make Work Smaller and Clearer

I used to write features like:  
❌ “Build OTA update checker”  

Now I write them like:  
✅ “Add preflight check for disk space before OTA update – observed 17% failure rate due to low space on v2.3 devices”

Clear inputs. Sharp context. Real data.  
Engineers respect specificity — it makes their job easier.

## 🪜 Lesson 5: Lead with Context, Stay Out of the Way

Great TPMs don’t make every decision. They create the conditions for good decisions.

When our ML infra team was deciding whether to move to MLflow or stick with custom logging, I didn’t push my preference.

Instead, I gathered:  
- Requirements from researchers (versioning, experiment tracking)  
- Constraints from infra (storage cost, S3 vs GCS)  
- Lessons from peer teams  

Then I said:  
> _“Here’s what everyone cares about. I’ll support the direction you choose — just let’s document trade-offs.”_

The decision was better — and owned.

## 🔁 Reflection: What I’d Do Differently

1. **Shadow other TPMs earlier** – It would’ve accelerated my stakeholder skills.
2. **Use visual roadmaps** – Text docs didn’t always get attention.
3. **Track wins, not just work** – I often forgot to highlight what went right.

## 💡 Final Thought

Becoming a TPM wasn’t about becoming a manager. It was about becoming a multiplier.
