Transitioning from an engineer to a Technical Product Manager (TPM) was not a linear career step. It was a shift from shipping computer vision models to shipping outcomes. From writing code to writing context. From owning features to owning alignment.

This is what I learned about influencing without authority.

### The Engineer’s Comfort Zone

As a computer vision engineer, life was scoped and concrete:  
- Tickets had clear definitions  
- Performance metrics were binary, accuracy up or down  
- Communication happened mostly through commits, pull requests, and model cards  

Value was easy to measure in models trained, bugs fixed.

Becoming a TPM meant becoming the bridge between engineering, product, operations, and leadership. That was the real stretch.

### The First Roadblock: “You’re Not My Manager”

Early on, I asked an MLOps engineer to reprioritize a deployment observability feature. The response was:  
_"We already have our sprint locked. Can’t pick that now."_  

Fair, but the outcome was still my responsibility. That is when I realized: as a TPM, you own problems, not people.

I needed to learn to influence without control.

### Align Around Outcomes, Not Output

Instead of asking, “Can you build this feature?”, I started framing it as:  

_"Our OTA failure rate spiked 22% last month. If we can monitor device state during update rollout, we can prevent 80% of failures."_  

That shifted the conversation from a request to an impact. Engineers push back on unclear asks, not on meaningful problems.

### Build Trust Before You Need It

Strong collaboration often began with informal alignment, Slack chats, short videos, lunch conversations.  

I would reach out with notes like:  
_"Saw you merged that data ingestion pipeline refactor. I think it could help with live tagging soon. Want to discuss?"_  

Those early touchpoints built relational equity so that when disagreements came later, we were already aligned on trust.

### Speak Their Language

Different stakeholders require different framing:  
- Engineers: latency budgets, tech debt ratios, performance bottlenecks  
- Designers: use-case personas, edge-device UX constraints  
- Operations: rollout risk, monitoring gaps, traceability  
- Executives: value delivered, timelines de-risked, customer impact  

Influence comes from fluency in multiple stakeholder dialects.

### Make Work Smaller and Clearer

A vague feature request like “Build OTA update checker” became:  

_"Add preflight check for disk space before OTA update, 17% failure rate due to low space on v2.3 devices."_

Clear context, real data, and specific outcomes make work easier to pick up and harder to ignore.

### Lead with Context, Stay Out of the Way

Great TPMs create the conditions for good decisions without making every decision themselves.   When our ML infrastructure team debated moving to MLflow versus keeping custom logging, I gathered requirements, constraints, and lessons from peers, then summarized them: 

_"Here’s what everyone cares about. I’ll support the decision you choose, just document the trade-offs."_  

The result was a better decision with shared ownership.

### Reflection: What I Would Do Differently

- Shadow other TPMs earlier to accelerate stakeholder skills  
- Use more visual roadmaps to make priorities visible  
- Track wins as well as work to highlight impact  

### Final Thought

Becoming a TPM was not about becoming a manager. It was about becoming a multiplier.
