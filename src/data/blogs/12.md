## Why API Design Matters More Than You Think

APIs aren’t just contracts — they are **long-term commitments** between systems, teams, and users. A bad API can slow down your velocity, increase tech debt, and frustrate partners. A well-designed one becomes an enabler for **scale, speed, and autonomy**.

In this post, I’ll walk through how I approach API integrations — both as a **consumer** and a **provider**.

---

## 1. **Start with the User — Not the Schema**

Whether it’s internal or external, ask:
- Who will consume this API?
- What are their pain points?
- How can we reduce their integration effort?

I often prototype API flows in tools like **Postman** or **Swagger** _before_ writing any backend code. This forces clarity.

---

## 2. **Follow Consistent Standards**

I use:
- **REST for CRUD-heavy services**
- **GraphQL** for flexible frontends
- **gRPC** for low-latency internal services

A consistent naming convention (`snake_case` vs `camelCase`, `POST /login` vs `GET /auth`) builds trust and predictability.

---

## 3. **Versioning Isn’t Optional**

💡 My rule: _Every public API must support versioning from Day 1._

Avoid breaking clients. Use URI versioning (`/v1/users`) or header-based (`Accept: application/vnd.company.v1+json`).

> We once broke 5 client SDKs by changing a single enum. Never again.

---

## 4. **Design for Failure, Not Just Happy Paths**

APIs live in the real world. That means:
- Timeouts
- Partial failures
- Missing fields
- Conflicting updates

Implement:
- **Idempotency keys** for POSTs
- **Retry logic** (with backoff)
- **Circuit breakers**

---

## 5. **Think in Contracts, Not Code**

Use tools like:
- **OpenAPI / Swagger** (for REST)
- **Protobuf** (for gRPC)
- **JSON Schema** (for validation)

> These become your **source of truth** between teams, even across orgs.

At Evercam, we standardized all internal APIs using Swagger UI — saved hours of Slack messages every week.

---

## 6. **Secure by Default**

Security can’t be bolted on. I default to:
- **OAuth2** / JWT for auth
- **Rate limiting** per client
- **Audit logging** for sensitive calls

For 3rd-party APIs, always:
- Rotate secrets
- Validate payloads
- Use IP whitelisting or HMACs where possible

---

## 7. **Logs Are Not Enough — Track Metrics**

Track per-endpoint metrics like:
- Error rate
- Latency (P50/P95)
- Request volume
- 4xx vs 5xx distribution

This has helped us identify slow integrations _before_ users complain.

---

## 8. **Document as You Go**

If someone needs a call to understand your API, you’ve failed.

Invest in:
- **Interactive docs** (Postman Collections, Swagger UI)
- **Code samples** (cURL, Python, JS)
- **Clear error messages**

> At one point, we reduced integration time from 2 weeks to 2 days just by improving docs.

---

## 9. **Mock and Test Extensively**

I use:
- **WireMock / MockServer** for fake upstreams
- **Contract tests** to validate integrations
- **Load tests** before rollout

It’s cheaper to fail in staging than in prod.

---

## 10. **Clean Up Deprecated APIs**

Build a deprecation strategy:
- Notify consumers
- Provide alternatives
- Set a sunset timeline

Clean APIs evolve — but with care.

---

## Final Thoughts

API integrations are where **system design meets real-world constraints**. The best APIs aren’t just clean code — they’re thoughtful, resilient contracts that empower others to build.
