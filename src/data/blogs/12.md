### Why Database Choice Is a Product Decision

As a Technical Product Manager, I have learned that choosing a database is as much a product decision as a technical one.

- The wrong choice can slow development, fail under scale, and force expensive migrations.  
- The right choice aligns with the data model, matches consistency and availability needs, and scales with the roadmap.

This is the framework I use to make that call.

### Start With the Data Shape and Access Patterns

Before picking a database, get clear on the shape of your data and how it will be accessed.

- If data is tabular and transactional, a relational database is likely best  
- If the schema is flexible with nested documents, consider a document store  
- If it is time-series metrics, look at a time-series database

Defining reads, writes, joins, and aggregation patterns early will narrow the options quickly.

### Decide on Transactional Integrity or Availability

Do you need strong consistency, or is eventual consistency acceptable?

Relational databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL are a good fit when:
- Strong consistency is required  
- Schema enforcement matters  
- Multi-table transactions are common  

NoSQL systems such as MongoDB, Cassandra, or DynamoDB work well when:
- Scalability and availability are the top priorities  
- Eventual consistency is acceptable  
- High write throughput is needed  

### Factor in Read and Write Load

Some workloads are write heavy, others are dominated by reads. Consider how this balance will change as you grow.

- Write heavy workloads may benefit from DynamoDB, Cassandra, or Kafka paired with a storage layer  
- Read heavy workloads with global traffic often need caches, read replicas, or globally distributed databases such as CockroachDB

Always design for the next order of magnitude in scale, not just for the current load.

### Be Honest About Operational Complexity

Who will operate the database?

- Self hosted PostgreSQL provides control but requires operational maturity  
- Managed services like DynamoDB, MongoDB Atlas, or PlanetScale reduce operational work but increase dependency on the provider  

Early stage products often benefit from managed services to speed up shipping.

### Separate Analytics From Transactions

Running analytics on the same database that powers transactions slows both down.

- OLTP workloads fit well on PostgreSQL or MySQL  
- OLAP workloads run better on BigQuery, Snowflake, or ClickHouse  
- Use ETL tools like dbt, Airbyte, or Apache NiFi to move data between systems

### Rules of Thumb

- Default to PostgreSQL unless there is a clear reason not to  
- Avoid sharding early, scale up or use replicas first  
- For MVPs, choose managed databases that minimize setup and maintenance
