When designing systems, especially in early-stage or scaling products, you face a constant tension: **Cost vs Performance**. As a Technical Product Manager, I’ve seen projects sink because teams over-optimized for one at the expense of the other. 

Here's how I’ve approached balancing these two forces across products, from MVPs to mature edge/cloud systems.

### Understand the Performance You Actually Need

Before you optimize anything, **define what “fast enough” means** for your use case. Don’t benchmark against Netflix or Stripe if your users are uploading photos once a week.

**Tip**: Always set SLOs early. Define:
- Acceptable latency  
- Maximum tolerable downtime  
- Throughput needs at peak traffic

### Go Small Before You Go Big

Many teams prematurely optimize with Kubernetes, multi-region deployments, or expensive DB clusters.

For one project, we started with:
- A monolith on a single VM  
- Postgres with daily backups  
- Manual scaling using Terraform scripts  

We didn’t hit a wall until we had over 2,000 daily active users, and by then, we had real usage data to inform our next scaling phase.

**Lesson**: Scale problems should be earned.

### Pick Cloud Services Strategically

Cloud lets you scale fast and burn money faster.

- Use managed services where ops cost > infra cost (e.g., Firebase Auth, AWS RDS)  
- Avoid lock-in for core components (e.g., ML pipelines, data lakes)  
- Use spot instances and autoscaling aggressively for bursty workloads

### Design for Observability, Not Just Resilience

Every minute debugging in production costs both **money** and **trust**.

We use a simple rule: if it moves, log it. If it breaks, alert it.

Recommended stack:
- **Grafana + Prometheus**: Metrics and dashboards  
- **Loki or CloudWatch Logs**: Log aggregation  
- **Sentry or PagerDuty**: Error tracking and alerting  

Observability helps you **prevent over-provisioning** by spotting real bottlenecks.

### Build for Iteration, Not Perfection

A system designed for experimentation can save more money in the long run than one optimized for stability on day one.
We shipped an MVP video analytics pipeline that processed low-res previews first and only ran full inference on high-confidence samples. This halved GPU costs without degrading UX.

### Final Thoughts

> Your system is only as good as what it costs to run it.

Cost-effective design isn’t about being cheap. It’s about being deliberate.  
If you're a PM or engineer making system design choices, ask:
- Is this the simplest architecture that meets our needs?  
- How will we know when it stops being enough?

**Stay lean. Stay smart. Measure everything.**
