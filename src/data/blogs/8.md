## The GenAI Inflection Point

As a Technical Product Manager (TPM) at the intersection of ML, DevOps, and edge deployments, I‚Äôve lived through the rapid integration of GenAI into our workflows. Prompting tools, copilots, and code generators are just the tip of the iceberg.

We‚Äôre not looking at a small shift. GenAI is reshaping **how TPMs operate, collaborate, and drive outcomes**.

## 1. Prompting ‚Üí Product Thinking

Good prompts aren‚Äôt just about syntax ‚Äî they reflect sharp problem framing. TPMs who can write clear, focused prompts are already building faster:

- üéØ Defining early PRDs by prompting GPT with use cases and constraints.
- ‚úçÔ∏è Drafting Jira epics via structured prompt templates.
- üõ†Ô∏è Using Claude or GPT-4 to break down technical requests into sprintable chunks.

It‚Äôs no longer ‚Äújust prompting.‚Äù It‚Äôs product design, reimagined.

## 2. GenAI for Stakeholder Comms

Where TPMs used to spend hours preparing updates, I now:

- Generate TL;DRs of weekly edge deployment reports using LLMs.
- Translate MLOps logs into business-friendly summaries.
- Use custom GPTs to synthesize feedback from user interviews, internal QA, and field engineers.

_Communication velocity has become a competitive advantage._

## 3. From Docs to Dynamic Agents

GenAI is shifting TPM workflows from static documentation to **interactive agents**:

- üîÑ Productboard meets GPT: auto-generate product requirement drafts from user feedback.
- ü§ñ Slackbots trained on our SOPs now answer deployment FAQs from sales and ops teams.
- üìä LLMs + BigQuery = faster insights on feature adoption or model drift.

We're not just shipping software anymore. We‚Äôre building systems that **think with us**.

## 4. Rewriting the Technical Stack

From managing MLflow pipelines to integrating TensorRT for low-latency inference on Jetson devices, I‚Äôve seen firsthand:

- LLMs can auto-generate YAMLs, Dockerfiles, and Airflow DAGs.
- Debugging TensorRT errors? GPT's been shockingly helpful.
- Evaluating model performance? I prompt it to critique eval outputs.

The line between ‚Äútechnical‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-technical‚Äù TPM is blurring.

## 5. PMs as Curators, Not Just Creators

You don‚Äôt have to generate everything from scratch.

> ‚ÄúThe new PM skill is *curation*: knowing which AI-generated ideas to keep, tweak, or discard.‚Äù

This is how I now approach:

- Roadmap brainstorming with team copilots.
- Feature ideation with design and eng using whiteboard GPTs.
- Trade-off documentation by auto-generating pros/cons and then refining collaboratively.

## Real Takeaways for TPMs

- **Learn to prompt like a PM**: tie prompts to goals, constraints, and edge cases.
- **Build your own tools**: fine-tuned GPTs for your org‚Äôs vocab and workflows = 10x ROI.
- **Audit your decisions**: GenAI is fast, but biased. PMs must stay the final filter.

## The Future Is Human-in-the-Loop

GenAI won‚Äôt replace TPMs. But TPMs who embrace GenAI will replace those who don‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm not spending less time on my job ‚Äî I‚Äôm spending more time where it matters: vision, alignment, influence, and velocity.

Because prompting is just the beginning.
