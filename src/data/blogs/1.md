When we started, we had ~100 edge devices deployed across construction sites. Within 14 months, we were supporting **1,200+ active nodes** across four continents ‚Äì with **real-time video processing**, **limited connectivity**, and **24/7 uptime requirements**.

We weren‚Äôt scaling a web app ‚Äî we were scaling **mission-critical edge infrastructure**. Here‚Äôs how we did it.

## üöß 1. Ground Reality: What Scaling Edge Really Means

Traditional web product scaling involves APIs, UIs, and cloud infra. Edge scaling is **messier**.

- Devices in unpredictable physical environments  
- Connectivity that breaks often  
- Hardware that may overheat, fail, or get misconfigured  
- Limited over-the-air update capabilities  
- Compliance/regulatory constraints across geographies  

As a TPM, my job was to **translate this chaos into a clear roadmap** for engineering, ops, and product stakeholders.

## üß† 2. Product & Platform Strategy

We split the product into 3 core tracks:

| Track                   | Objective                                      | Outcome                                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Edge Infra Platform** | Hardware selection, device OS, logging, OTA   | Standardized firmware & remote updates      |
| **Computer Vision SDK** | Modular AI models, plug-and-play integration  | Model performance ‚Üë, deployment speed ‚Üë     |
| **Observability Stack** | Health monitoring, logs, alerts                | Reduced downtime by 40%                     |

### Strategic Decision  
We moved from **manual device provisioning** to a **self-registration bootstrap protocol**, reducing deployment friction by 70%.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 3. Technical Execution & Alignment

### üß© Challenges

- **Device observability**: We couldn‚Äôt fix what we couldn‚Äôt see.  
- **Model deployment coordination**: AI models needed version tracking and rollback.  
- **Hardware fragmentation**: Different Nvidia Jetsons, Raspberry Pis, and custom boards.  

### üîß Solutions

- Built a **custom metrics + log forwarder** over MQTT ‚Üí routed to Prometheus + Grafana.  
- Integrated **model versioning via MLflow**, accessible through the device's local agent.  
- Established a **hardware compatibility matrix** + firmware validator.

## üìä 4. Metrics That Mattered

| Metric                     | Before     | After       | Impact                          |
|----------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Device Online Uptime       | ~92%       | **98.5%**   | Fewer customer complaints        |
| Time to Provision a Device | ~2.5 hrs   | **<25 mins**| Enabled rapid scaling            |
| Model Update Rollbacks     | Frequent   | **Near-zero** | Stable AI rollout                |
| Support Tickets (per site) | ~5/week    | **<1/week** | Saved ops team ~12 hrs/week     |

---

## ü§ù 5. Leading Cross-Functional Execution

As TPM, I worked across:

- **Hardware Engineering** ‚Äì spec validation, thermal compliance  
- **DevOps** ‚Äì CI/CD pipelines, secrets management  
- **AI/ML Engineers** ‚Äì modularizing models for edge inferencing  
- **Support & Ops** ‚Äì feedback loop from field failures  
- **Customers** ‚Äì device usage and customizations  

**Weekly war rooms ‚Üí Monthly OKR reviews ‚Üí Quarterly roadmap pivots**  
This rhythm kept everyone aligned and proactive, not reactive.

## üß† 6. Key Learnings

- **Edge ‚â† Cloud**: Success on AWS means nothing if your Jetson is throttling in 45¬∞C heat.  
- **Metrics-first thinking** is non-negotiable. Observability is your lifeline.  
- **Rollbacks save your neck**. No model or firmware rollout is perfect.  
- **Your ops team is your best friend**. They know the real world your product lives in.  
- **TPMs must see the system end-to-end**, not just Gantt charts.  

---

## üöÄ Impact Summary

- Scaled product deployments from **100 ‚Üí 1,200+** devices  
- Reduced field issues and provisioning time drastically  
- Enabled AI model velocity with minimal rollback risk  
- Created scalable systems for remote device health, logging, and updates
