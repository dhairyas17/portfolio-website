As a TPM working on edge AI products, one of my core challenges wasn’t just “what to build” — it was **what not to build**.

When you're at the intersection of firmware, DevOps, machine learning, and user experience — prioritization becomes more of a system design problem than a roadmap checklist.

## ⚖️ The Chaos: 3 Streams, One Roadmap

In our product lifecycle, every quarter brought a flood of requests:

- 🧠 **Product/UX**: “We need smarter alerts, real-time tagging, smoother UI.”
- 🔧 **Firmware/Hardware**: “Jetson Xavier requires patching for new models, thermal fixes needed.”
- 🛠️ **DevOps**: “CI/CD is fragile; models aren’t reproducible. We need infra upgrades.”

The real problem? **All three teams were right.** But we had limited time, edge devices already in the field, and OKRs to meet.

---

## 🧮 Step 1: Triage with RICE + MoSCoW

We created a **hybrid prioritization model** combining RICE and MoSCoW.

### ✅ RICE Framework
We used RICE to score initiatives on:
- **Reach**: How many customers/devices?
- **Impact**: On performance, NPS, conversion?
- **Confidence**: Do we have data or just assumptions?
- **Effort**: Measured in sprint points or team capacity.

### 🧭 MoSCoW Applied to OKRs
Once RICE was done, we layered MoSCoW:
- **Must-Have**: Tied directly to quarterly OKRs.
- **Should-Have**: Big wins, but deferable.
- **Could-Have**: Good ideas, but no pressure.
- **Won’t-Have (Now)**: Parked for review later.

## 🧰 Step 2: Structured Inputs with Productboard

We operationalized this using **Productboard**:

- Feature ideas were tagged as `UX`, `Infra`, `Firmware`, etc.
- Each idea was linked to **feedback entries**, **support tickets**, and **internal objectives**.
- Every week, I ran triage with Engineering and PMs to re-score based on fresh context.

---

## 🧪 Real Trade-offs

> “Should we spend 2 weeks on smoother firmware upgrades, or fix the labeling UI for faster onboarding?”

We faced dozens of these.

Some of the hard calls:

- Prioritized **firmware OTA patching** over a new UX feature — since device downtime cost customers more than friction in the UI.
- Deferred **model versioning infra** because UX complaints from pilots were risking churn.
- Rewrote **the alert module pipeline** instead of iterating on NPS feedback — because DevOps stability was becoming a blocker.

---

## 🧩 Stakeholder Mini-Stories

- 🔧 **“Ops team flagged device dropouts during updates…”**  
We prioritized firmware rollback safety after joint testing.

- 🧪 **“PMs pushed for faster deployment UI…”**  
We built a deployment dashboard MVP, even though DevOps wanted to focus elsewhere.

- 🤝 **“We aligned via Monday 3-way reviews…”**  
Every sprint began with joint review from UX, ML, and Engineering leads. This reduced ping-pong between functions.

> **“In edge products, shipping a feature means shipping reliability – twice: in code and in deployment.”**

## 🧠 Reflection: What I’d Do Differently

If I were to run this again:

- I’d **build visual dashboards for real-time RICE/MoSCoW trade-offs** — too much lived in memory and spreadsheets.
- Create a **‘parking lot’ review process** for Could-Haves every 4 weeks.
- Get better at saying **no with context**, not just “later.”

## ✅ Summary

Prioritization isn't a checklist. It’s **orchestration** — aligning teams with different rhythms, languages, and stakes.

As a TPM, using frameworks is only half the game. The other half is building trust that you're making the right calls — even when they’re tough ones.
